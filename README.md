# College-App
College App with location based attendance

# Introduction

We are presenting a College App which will give a better user interface in android application. It provides an overview about the notices, college location and different events in college through notification.
An Individual can create an account as students, faculty or HOD. Faculty can share the notices with students studying in their department and students can view those notices. Notices sent can be a text-based notice or they can upload documents as required. Students will get a notification on their phone regarding the notice and they can view the notice or download the pdf. All the notices come with an expiry date and automatically get deleted and get stored in the expired notice section. Google Location is provided to see the location of student, professor and HOD with their check out and check in time. With the help of global chat students can communicate with each other.

# Proposed system

4.1 Proposed System:
• Proposed system is an android based system which will allow students to receive notices any time . 

• HOD/Staff/Office/Library can send notice at any time. 

• Notice by the office will be sent to all.

 • Notice by HOD/Teacher will be sent to the respective department’s student. 
 
• Students can see the users(other students and staff) of the same department.

 • HOD can view students and staff of their department and other departments.
 
 • Each notice will have a till date (time till which the notice will be shown on on-going notices screen) .
 
• It will have a registration screen where users can register for their particular course and as a student/staff/hod etc.

 • Only faculty members will post notice. The students will receive notice from their respective department only. For example, the student studying in IT can receive notice from the IT department only, not from other academic department.
 
 • In addition to that, students will receive notice from non academic department like, library, Office, Gymkhana, etc .
 
• Only faculty members can upload the attendance of the students in their branch. 

• Students can check their own attendance and not of any other student.
